# Urban Geometry

This photographic series explores the geometric patterns and architectural forms found in urban environments. Through careful composition and black-and-white processing, the images reveal the hidden beauty in everyday city structures.

## Concept

The series examines how modern architecture creates geometric patterns that often go unnoticed in our daily lives. By removing color and focusing on form, light, and shadow, the photographs emphasize the structural beauty and mathematical precision of urban design.

## Technical Details

- **Camera**: Sony A7R IV
- **Lens**: 24-70mm f/2.8 GM
- **Settings**: Various, optimized for architectural photography
- **Processing**: Black and white conversion with careful tonal adjustments
- **Print Size**: Available in multiple sizes up to 24" x 36"

## Composition Approach

Each photograph in the series follows specific compositional principles:
- **Leading Lines**: Using architectural elements to guide the viewer's eye
- **Symmetry and Asymmetry**: Balancing geometric forms for visual interest
- **Negative Space**: Strategic use of empty areas to emphasize subjects
- **Light and Shadow**: Capturing the dramatic interplay of natural and artificial light

## Locations

The series was shot across multiple cities, including:
- New York City (Manhattan architecture)
- Chicago (Modernist buildings)
- Tokyo (Contemporary urban design)
- London (Historical and modern structures)

## Artistic Statement

Urban Geometry challenges viewers to see the beauty in the built environment around them. It transforms everyday cityscapes into abstract compositions that celebrate human creativity and engineering while highlighting the mathematical harmony present in urban design.

## Exhibition History

- Featured in "Modern Urban Perspectives" gallery show (2024)
- Selected for "Architecture in Focus" photography competition
- Published in Urban Photography Quarterly
