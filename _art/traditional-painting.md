# Abstract Harmony

This piece represents a journey into abstract expressionism, combining traditional painting techniques with modern mixed media approaches. It explores the relationship between color, form, and emotion through a carefully orchestrated composition.

## Concept

2. Base layer application with acrylic paints
3. Collage element integration
4. Ink detailing and final adjustments
5. Varnishing and preservation

## Impact
