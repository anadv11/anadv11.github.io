Nth floor, after the carpet stain and the rose  
She knows how to make a house a home  
The light is soft, the air is cold  
And we're just in our own world  
Of yarn, and fabric and corn. 

I played games with strangers  
That felt like friends  
And my friends briefly felt like strangers  
Until the kettle went off  
And the oolong melted the ice.

And it snowed, and my cheeks burned  
And I ran in a park that looked like mine  
Castle lake and dogs and all.

We fumble with the foreign and familiar  
In a cocktail maker that was meant for margaritas  
The trains are yellow, hugs are warm,  
But the words mean nothing on their own.
  
I wake up to the smell of fresh scones  
Like when we were young(er)  
And we had all that going on.  
But now there is more nuance  
And we already know the song.
