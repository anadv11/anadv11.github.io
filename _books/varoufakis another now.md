This book plays with the past the present and the future of the reader and of the main characters. It manages to set up the principles of an alternative future in a great level of detail given how short it is.
it has space for technical details on how the monetary regime would function but also to develop chanracter personalities and their relations. Additionally Varoufakis still manages to set up a contemporary critique of our societies, including the Covid-19 crisis.
I was mostly hopeful through the book but became a bit pessimistic towards the end when the issue of feminism is discussed.
I would highly recommend!
