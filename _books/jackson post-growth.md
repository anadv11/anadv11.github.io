I found this book midway through my degrowth journey. I expected a fierce and well-constructed academic critique and in addition to that, I found eye-watering stories and life lessons. A well-written book that is good for both newcomers to the movement and seasoned post-growthers.

It gives a long term perspective: capitalism has not been with us forever and we, in a way, create and legitimise it (though he puts no blame on individuals)

Great thinkers are introduced in every single chapter: my favourite wete Rosa Luxemburg, Hannah Arendt and Mill (who already talked about the stationary state, by the way!)
