Studying social justice and environmental issues is not a happy task most of the time. It is about transgressed planetary boundaries, time running out, and inequality being reproduced over and over in so many different directions.

I get a lot of hope from people and community, but I also have found books that, for how they help me imagine the future, in a fictional or an academic way, have made me feel like we can still win. They are little pockets of hope and warmth (in the best of ways). Here they are, I hope they are as helpful to you as they have been to me. 

And yes, I recommend them all as a birthday gift.
