I’m currently doing a PhD in post‑growth policy at the University of Barcelona under the supervision of Federico Demaria and Filka Sekulova as part of the [MAPS project](https://mapsresearch.eu).

My aim is to analyse post-growth policies and their interaction with dominant economic discourse and practices. I am most interested in creating space for alternatives to flourish and on how to nourish better futures.

While I am based in the School of Sociology, I have a multi-disciplinary background and I often draw from Political Economy, Geography, Ecological Economics and STS in my work. Methodologically, I like to draw on discuourse analysis and use computational social science approaches.

In the past, I have worked as a policy researcher at the OECD and REN21, focusing on issues of energy and climate negotiations in the framework of the UNFCCC.

I am also an avid crossword solver, poetry writer, crafter and sport-doer.
