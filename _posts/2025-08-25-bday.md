Hi Glen,

Happy birthday! 

You have mentioned not-too-high expectations around such dates, but I think they are excellent excuses for carving time to do the silly, extra and fun things that we would do in any case, but in a higher density.

I really wish I could be [there], together, and I really wish we could hug and kiss and cuddle and sit somewhere for a long time and look at things and talk and then not talk. But to be fair, this is not exclusive to today.   

In any case, I am happy that you are in very excellent company :)

I tried (in a very chaotic manner) to deliver my _birthday gifts_ while we were together as much as possible, but there is one more I can send through the waves.   
 
__Obviously__, I tried to make you a crossword.  
__Obviously__ too, it has so many holes and potentially some non-existent words. It may be unsolvable.  
And __obviously__, it contains as much joy and excitement and as much _us_ as I could possibly fit around all those shaded squares.  

I am not sure what day of the week it would have belonged to... 

Love u!
